# **App Name**: AgriPredict

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Allow users to upload images of crops for disease detection.
- Disease Prediction: Use AI to predict potential crop diseases based on uploaded images.
- Yield Prediction: Estimate crop yield based on user inputs such as crop type, region, and historical data.
- Feasibility Analysis: Determine the feasibility of growing specific crops in a given area using environmental and economic data. The LLM will use uploaded images as a tool to assess feasibility.
- Data Visualization: Present prediction results through charts and graphs.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Fresh green (#8BC34A) to reflect agriculture and growth.
- Background color: Light green (#F1F8E9), a desaturated hue of the primary color.
- Accent color: Earthy brown (#A1887F) to symbolize soil and stability; contrasts nicely with green for key actions.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality; suitable for headlines or body text.
- Use nature-inspired icons to represent different crops, diseases, and environmental factors.
- Design a clean, intuitive interface with easy navigation for users of all technical backgrounds.
- Incorporate subtle animations to provide feedback during analysis and prediction processes.
